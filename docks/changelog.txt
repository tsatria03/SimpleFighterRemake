Finally fixed falling off of map Boundaries! I have know idea how this bug became apparent in recent versions of the game, but it should hopefully be fixed once and for all.
The volume and pitch sliders now anounce values in percentages, not actual numbers. The reverb sliders will remain largely unchanged, aside from a few tweaks here and their.
Made it so objects that take the volume and pitch parameter use sliders to adjust them instead of the vertual input box asking the user to type in the values they want. This change also applies to the other game modes as well, not just the builder mode.

new in 5.1
Started working on slider support for adjusting effect parameters.
Fixed a bug where hazards would spawn random ledge platforms on both sides that were different than the ones spesified on the left side of the hazard.

new in 2.9
Started working on parsing shields. They are not ready to be used as of right now. You can still equip and unequip them in the shields menu. This will be changed later on.
Fixed writing map objects to a file not working propperly.
Documentation versions can now be read by a file without having to modify the code directly. This file can be found under the docks folder of the game. The version.txt file will be altered any time I update the change log file.
Platforms, staircases, and walls will now get written to the map file you're currently building in.
Adjusted fall damage. If you fall from 8 tiles or more, your health will be deducted based on how high you fell. This will be multiplied by 21. For example, if you had 1000 health, and you fell 8 tiles, your health would be subtracted by 8, witch would normaly be 992, but if you times that by 21, you'll actually have 832 health, or 83.2 percent of your maximum health.
You can now jump up the staircase by pressing the spacebar. This is useful if you want to get up their faster without having to climb up one step at a time.
Fixed staircases still playing the tile sounds while jumping on them.
Made it so pressing left, right, up, or down arrow keys turn your character on the spot without having to press alt to do it.
Recoded turrning logic.
Reverted the keyboard layout back to what the normal game modes had. This time, space will be used to jump, control will be used to fire weapons, and alt will be used to run.
new in 2.8
Jump time is no longer parsed, and therefore will not be used in the game for all characters.
Removed the keys grave, 1, 2, and 3 for spying. These keys are now replaced by the shift and arrow keys to spy left, right, up, and down.
Addressed an issue pertaining to one of the other game modes playing a random continuous fall sound unless the user exited it and whent back to the game's menu. I didn't realize this sound belonged to some code I previously implemented that would drop the user after 60 seconds if they were in the air for too long. In any case, this code has been removed.
You can no longer jump or climb staircases while sitting. Idk how that was even possible to begin with.
Addressed an issue where the death dialog would continuesly pop up after you have died in the builder mode.
Fixed an issue where you were able to jump while being on top of a staircase. From now on, if you are on the stairs, you won't be able to jump. Instead, you'll have to climb it like a normal flight of stairs.
You can now jump onto platforms and staircases! Thanks once again to Parker Watson for the huge help in fixing that. I had a feeling this had to be one of my pryoridies to deal with, amung other things.
Changed the jumping, running, and firing keys to match with the keys set in the other game modes. In the builder mode, Space will now fire weapons, holding control plus left or right arrows will run, and pressing up arrow will make you jump.
Recoded jumping and falling to work better with platforms, staircases, and walls.
Recoded the intire map system.
new in 2.7
You can now download all of the sounds right from within the game! When you open it for the first time, it will ask you if you want to download them or not. I recommend pressing yes on that, otherwise the game will run without them, wich wouldn't be good. You may also have to extract the sounds yourself, as I don't have a way to automaticly extract it and put them where they belong.
Addressed an issue pertaining to question based menus playing music when they weren't supposed to.
Cleaned up the menu code, again. Apparently I loved to cludder up things in their lol.
Added a prompt to all buildable npcs that asks if you want any of them to folow you up on platforms or not. This is useful for making higher floors on the map, and you want them to stay down at the bottom.
Added back the select character type option into the main settings menu.
Character selections and their attributes can finally be saved! Sorry if it took me an extremely long time to debug the issue. All of them can now be modified and ran like normal.
You can now view how much ammo you have left for weapons that take it in the statistics menu.
You can now view how many enemies have spawned on the map while playing one of the other game modes in the statistics menu. These stats will only apply to playing the other two game modes, not the actual builder mode.
You can now view how long you've been playing the game in the statistics menu.
The maps menu now only speaks the base name of the map file, rather than apending an extencion to the end of it.
new in 2.6
Fixed maps not being able to load propperly after they have been built within the main map menu of the game. If you've built a map with a name such as main, with the maximum length and height set to 50, and with the tile set to anything you want, you'll now be able to load it back from within the load maps menu for easy retreivel.
Made it so when you press R while a weapon with ammo is loaded, it doesn't reload it when there's already a set amount of ammo in it. From now on, you can only reload the weapon if the loaded ammo reaches 0 for that particular weapon.
Cleaned up lots of code related to playing sounds if an error occured anywear in the game. Dialogs will now play those sounds instead of the normal sound_pool.
The statistics menu intro will now tell you how many entries there are Available to view upon launching it.
You can now view the folowing statistics. Current location, current overall health, maximum jumpheight, maximum X position, maximum Y position, current level/experience, current amount of points, and total kills for all enemies. More may be added soon.
Added the pause menu to all of the game modes. This let's you view statistics right from within the menu, and resume the game when needed.
Updated the credits file with more of the people who contributed to this project. Please check them out if you can.

Removed unused variables and cheats from the game do to them already being present in some of the character and weapon files.
Made it so using an item from the items menu in the game heals you 25 percent of your maximum health.
Added the ability to auto save all games. This can be toggled in the main settings menu.
Made it so upgrading maximum ammo is only possible if you've equipped a weapon that takes it.
Added checks for things such as attack, defence, health, and other character related things so none of them go over or under those asined values.
The level up sound will now play by default. I forgot why it was disabled to begin with.
You can now upgrade your shield's defence in the points menu.
Maps automaticly get written to a file when creating new maps for easy access when you want to load them back.
Fixed maps not loading propperly. I accidentally put .map in place of the file open function when trying to load it. Instead of saying test.map, it said test.map.map.
new in 2.4
Completely ilimenated the old clunky map parser that was used in the save data class. I forgot to get rid of the settings and reset functions for it. Woops.
You can now finally create your own maps with a file and load it into the game for use. As of right now, you can only spawn platforms, starecases, and walls, but more will be added later as time goes on. There's also a test map found in data/maps. Check it out!
Made the toggle anouncements less verbose in the settings menu. Instead of saying something like, up and down in all menus enabled, or up and down in all menus disabled, it will now say something like, up and down enabled, or up and down disabled.
Fixed lots of issues related to the settings menu of the game. You can now enable and disable all of the items in their like normal, and it will instently take effect the next time you save your settings and reopen the game.
You can now spawn walls independent of platforms in the builder menu. I know you could already do that, but I decided to seperate walls from platforms in the code for better organization.
Ripped out the dummy map parser that was used by the save data class. I'm going to start working on a real map parser that hopefully works to load and save maps of all lengths. The old map system was just a glorified save file that was loaded every time I called the read_map function when loading a map from the map.dat file.
Added the ability to load and save boolion variables to Mason's save data class.
Addressed an issue where hrtf refused to be saved after it's been toggeled on or off in the settings menu.

Fixed menu callbacks with artillery weapons. You can now preview the sounds for them like normal.
new in 2.3
Removed the letter U key from the readme file, as it was no longer being used in the game. This key may have other uses in the future.

Asined a default weapon category and type to all of the game modes.
Asined a default character to all of the game modes.
Did some more cleanup in all of the menus.

You can now asine atributes to weapons! You can find their info at data/layouts/equipments/weapons/weapontype/your weapon.
Moved the characters menu to the main settings menu of the game. The letter U key is no longer used to select your character.
Addressed an issue where if you opened the game and tried playing one of the modes, nothing in the character files would be parsed unless you directly whent into the characters menu and chose something in their that would trigger it to be reparsed.
Fixed some typos in the readme. D was supposed to be used to increase your moving speed, not S.
Added the ability to speak atribute info of a character file when you hover over it in the characters menu. Thanks again to Parker Watson for the help in extensively testing the thing. There were so many issues with the menu callback function that I decided to take matters into my own hands and whent threw all of the menu functions that were being used in other menus I implemented to figure out what was wrong with it.
Recoded character parsing. Thanks goes to Parker Watson for the huge help. I initially didn't ask for it, but I'm grateful nonetheless. I admit it was probably a bit messy to go through looking back at it lol.
Added the maps folder. This will be used in the future to make and save maps to a file.
Added error checking to menu sounds.
Added lives and points into all of the character's files. Lives is used in the game to tell you how many lives you have before the game officially ends. Points is used in the game for upgrading purposes. The higher the value, the more you'll have to put into your stats.
new in 2.1
Added the ability to asine atributes to characters with a file. You can find this under data/layouts/characters/your character. More will be coming soon!
Reorganized the data folder a bit, and added the folowing folders. The saves folder will now contain everything to do with saving data related to the actuall game and it's prefferences. The layouts folder will now contain everything to do with making files related to actions performed in all of the game modes. You'll soon be able to asine atributes to different types of characters, weapons, NPCS, and shields with there respected files.
Cleaned up some menu code in the settings porssion of the game.
Sounds no longer destroy themselves after spawnning a vehicle on the map.
You can now enable and disable global hrtf support in the settings menu.
Made it so items in your inventory heal you a sertain percentage of your health, rather than healing you by 1 every time.
Added more error checking to sounds, especially in the normal game modes.
Removed saving of maps for now, as I still need to test it's capabilities, possibley replacing it altogether.
Finally added keyboard documentation in the readme! This took me super duper long to do, but was worth every bit of my tired aking brain so early in the morning. If I've missed anything, please let me know asap!
Fixed a critical runtime error caused by the bullets class. I had to go in their and change all of the continue statements to return ones. My bad on that one lol.
new in 2.0
Added entries in the credits file. Please do look at it if you dare to choose to do so.
Finally fixed the game severely lagging when too many objects spawned on the map. From now on, you can't have more than 50 animals, enemies, projectiles, robots, and zombies at once on any of the game modes being played. This also applies to the builder mode as well.
Addressed an ishue regarding bullit loop sounds still playing if the bullet's range has exceeded it's maximum value. The bullet loop sounds for archery, artillery, and explosive weapons should destroy propperly upon firing bullets with very little range to them.
Maps can no longer be built without platforms. If you tried building a map, it will alert the user that there aren't any platforms available to view, therefore bringing them back to the map menu in the process.
Recoded error checking for all sounds! If the game can't find what it's looking for in any of the folders given, it will raze an error, rather than letting the user continue dooing the task that has been requested, such as building an object, using weapons and shields, choosing characters etc.
You can now upgrade your horizontal and vertical weapon ranges in the points menu.
Finally fixed weapon ranges! Bullets will no longer travel untill the end of a boundry unless you're close to it. Your horizontal and vertical weapon ranges will determine where the bullets will end up on the map.
Redesigned the points menu. Instead of bringing up a menu to perchis the amount of points you want to buy for that particular upgrade, it will now bring up an input box that let's you type the number of points you want to invest in that upgrade, such as attack and defence. You no longer need to worry about the game crashing if you have too many points.
Added ricochet sounds to all of the melee weapons.
Added loop sounds to all of the explosive weapons.
Added ricochet, reload, and shell  sounds to all of the artillery weapons.
Fixed other sounds destroying itself in the bullet class, especially when they bounce off walls.
Fixed an issue where bullets kept bouncing endlessly when they had knoware else to go, especially if you jumpped while it was moving to the right or left. Bullets now destroy themselves after reaching the end of a boundary. As long as there's a wall on either side of you, they will still bounce off of it.
Redesigned the way bullets function. Not only they bounce off of walls, they can actualy come back the other way and hit you if you're in the way of them while they're traveling. Dodging is possible, depending on where they come from.
Made it so bullets destroy themselves after hitting a wall or a boundry.
You can now asine ids to reverb effects.
Reorganized the vehicles folder a bit. Moved extra loop sounds that were in some of the folders and put them into separate folders.
Addressed an ishue pertaining to weapon ammo clearing itself after a melee weapon has been selected. You can now reload all weapons with ammo normaly.
Added hrtf and reverb support to all game elements. The folowing can be adjusted. Dry, from 0.1 to 1.0. Wet, from 0.1 to 1.0. Room_size, from 0.1 to 1.0. Dampping, from 0.1 to 1.0. Width, from 0.1 to 1.0. As of right now, you can only spawn one of them at a time. Untill I find a way to fix this, you may have to destroy the map and rebuild the effect from scratch, if you want it someware else on the map.
Converted the intire game to nvgt.
new in 1.0
Finally added vehicles. This took an extremely long time to decide and refactor. To get inside of one, make sure you are neare it, and press enter to start it up. It will go at speed 5 by default. To stop the vehicle from moving, press enter again. To increase/decrease speed, press up or down arrows. To turn the vehicle, press left or right arrows. To honk your horn, press space.
Ripped out the masonasons game engin, and replaced it with a better map system that works quite well.
Added the upgrade points menu in the regular game mode. You can increase the folowing stats while playing the normal/custom mode. attack, defence, health, ammo, and shield strength. The more points you have after leveling up, the more you can invest in your upgrades. Your attack will increase the overall damage of all weapons. Your defence will increase the overall resistance of your character, making it so enemies can't easyly hurt you.
Added the object info menu in all game modes. The folowing objects can be viewed. Animals, enemies, projectiles, robots, and zombies. These will tell you where they are in relationship to you, and there overall health in percentages when viewed in the menu.
You can now pause and resume the game by pressing the letter P.
You can now view how long you've been playing the game by pressing the letter Y.
