sign 0 0 Welcome to the Simple Fighter main map. This map showcases various game objects and building features using zones. Explore to learn about different objects! Note: all signs including this one are destroyable. If you get tired of reading, just beat the living hell out of them, and they'll happily go away for good. Unless you reload the map that is. I mean ahem, did I just say that? Woops! Anyways enjoy exploring! sign true false

dialog 155 165 0 0 Welcome to the dialog zone!--A dialog is an interactable element in the game that displays messages to the user when they step over it or press the Enter key on it.--Dialogs can contain multiple lines of text, making it so players can scroll through longer messages.--This is most useful for storytelling instructions, but can easily be used for anything else that doesn't require the use of signs or text squares to display messages to the user.--These can also be placed anywhere on the map.--Try creating your own dialog to enhance your game! dlg5 true
